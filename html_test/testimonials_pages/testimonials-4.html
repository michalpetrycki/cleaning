					<h2><i>“I would encourage anyone to go for it. I understand the possible hesitation but I am happy to confirm 
						all that you see about this business is true.”</i></h2>
					<p>Steven runs our Redditch and Bromsgrove area. He decided on the franchising route to starting a business as
						he was looking for a proven and supported way of running a business with limited risk. So why a cleaning 
						franchise? Steven told us <i>“Having been in retail before this time I wanted something that would be service
						based that would provide ongoing residual income.”</i></p>
					<p>We asked Steven why he chose Diamond Home Support. He told us <i>“Compared to other similar opportunities the 
						start up and ongoing costs are very low. My impression having talked to Andrew at Head Office and other 
						existing franchisees was that of an honest, straight forward, no frills company that offered great support.”</i></p>
					<p>Steven has only recently joined the business, but he told us <i>“Very quickly my first impressions were confirmed
						and the support was second to none. After taking 4 weeks to set the business up properly good quality workers
						were joining the database and the first clients were starting to enquire. Although it was a whirlwind few weeks
						it was also enjoyable.”</i></p>
					<p>We asked Steven how he found the support from the Franchisor? He told us <i>“Excellent. Any questions are answered
						very quickly and there is an openness in discussions that encourages forward thinking and growth.”</i></p>
					<p>Steven told us the main benefits of the business were <i>“Apart from the excitement of building an income on a monthly
						basis I do enjoy the interaction with clients and workers and feeling like you are giving something of value to both.”</i></p>
					<p>When looking to the future Steven said <i>“I am excited and look forward to a time in a few years when I can look back at 
						the hard work put in and enjoy the rewards while looking to the future and semi retirement.”</i></p>
					<p>We asked Steven what advice he would give to potential franchisees. He told us <i>“Understand that it is a real opportunity
						but be realistic. Rewards will in the main depend on effort put in and hours available. Also a positive attitude and 
						the ability to follow a proven manual and business model. Given enough time and patience it is possible to build a good 
						income and a future asset. The prospectus is proving to be very accurate.</p>
					<p>I would encourage anyone to go for it. I understand the possible hesitation but I am happy to confirm all that you 
						see about this business is true.”</i></p>
					<p>When asked if he would do anything differently if starting over again Steven told us he would have started years ago!</p>
