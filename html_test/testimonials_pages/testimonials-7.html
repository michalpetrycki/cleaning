					<p><i>I signed up as a Diamond Home Support franchisee in April 2014. My original ambition had been to have a care 
						company providing domiciliary care (i.e. personal care as well as domestic services); however, the amount of 
						money required for this was enormous. I came across Diamond Home Support during the course of my research into
						domiciliary care franchises, and asked Andrew if I could focus mainly on the “Home Assist” service, to which 
						the answer was “yes”.</i></p>
					<p>I duly agreed my territory and signed up as a franchisee, and I have not looked back since! Admittedly, things
						were slow to begin with but, having been in business on my own account before, I knew what to expect. I was not
						at all disheartened by the fact that it took a while for the calls to start coming in, and a little longer for 
						me to be at a stage where I could actually take money out of the business; this is something which you have to
						expect when you first start up. I would advise anyone thinking of starting a business of any sort to ensure 
						that they had enough money behind them to live comfortably for at least six months so that they can give the 
						business their full attention rather than spending time worrying about how they are going to pay their bills.</p>
					<p>I have made my share of mistakes along the way; mainly in terms of being sucked into various forms of advertising. 
						However, I have now found what works for me and am sticking to that; a leaflet drop approximately every three months,
						and a once a month advertisement with an editorial in my local newspaper.</p>
					<p>Today I am building both a reputation AND a business, and I can honestly say that I have never been happier! I have been
						told by local people that I am unique in the market place, and I am receiving excellent feedback from my clients as well
						as recommendations. I have built a wonderful team of girls, all of whom are happy working with me and are prepared to go
						the extra mile.</p>
					<p>I can honestly say that I have never been happier in my working life. I am thoroughly enjoying meeting and getting to know
						new people (clients and workers alike), and go to bed each evening proud of what I have achieved and AM achieving. To know
						that Diamond Home Support Monmouthshire is making a difference to people’s lives; both the lives of the clients who are 
						receiving a service second to none, and to the the lives of my workers, most of whom are Mums or single Mums gives me 
						enormous satisfaction, and I’m earning money doing it!”</i></p>
