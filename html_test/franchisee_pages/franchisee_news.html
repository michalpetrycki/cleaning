						<h3>August 2016</h3>
						<p>We recorded record website visitor figures during June, now we have experienced record numbers of calls to our call centre during July.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>July 2016</h3>
						<p>In June our website recorded its biggest one day set of visitors, and its biggest set of weekly visitors, AND the biggest monthly visitor
							figures we have ever had! That’s the kind of demand we are currently experiencing.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>June 2016</h3>
						<p>13 people have joined the Diamond Home Support cleaning, home help and gardening franchise network since the start of 2016. Let us tell you why.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>May 2016</h3>
						<p>Recent research has shown that almost one in ten people in the UK have a domestic cleaner. That is a 24% rise in just 5 years. The rise in demand 
							appears to have been driven particularly by the under 35’s. Almost twice as many under 35’s now have a cleaner when compared to over 35’s.</p>
						<p>The research suggests that the rise in demand for domestic cleaners is because: they work long hours; they have a busy social life; or they want the
							job done properly.</p>
						<p>Sounds like a reasonable basis to consider running a cleaning business!</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>March 2016 – Surge in the demand for domestic cleaners – so says research!</h3>
						<p>Recent research by the insurer esure has shown a huge rise in the demand for domestic cleaning services over the past 5 years. The research shows 
							that nearly five million people now have a cleaner – that is an increase of 24% compared with 2011.</p>
						<p>Working long hours and a busy social life are amongst the reasons given for this rise in demand. Is it any wonder therefore why the domestic cleaning
							business is the one to be in right now!</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>March 2016 – Bespoke Diamond Online Database Application Launched!</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support now has its own bespoke online database application. Franchisees can now do much of their administration through our bespoke online application.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>February 2016 – 7 Franchisees in 7 Weeks!</h3>
						<p>Yes we have had a terrific start to 2016 with 7 franchisees joining our network in the first 7 weeks of the year.</p>
						<p>Why has this happened? In simple terms it is because 7 people have realised the significant potential there is in running a Diamond Home Support franchise business.</p>
						<p>When we think back about those 7 who have joined us they all had their own motivation and drivers, but there were some key factors which helped them make their decision
							and these might also be factors which help you in deciding if our franchise might be for you too…</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Domestic cleaning is a genuinely in-demand service. No longer is it seen as a luxury. Oh no, for many it is now a necessity and something they
								would not and could not do without. For the busy family it gives them time at the weekends together. For the stressed, hard working professional, 
								it gives them something less to worry about. For the elderly, it means they can relax in the knowledge that others can now do for them what they 
								can no longer do.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our franchise business model includes three revenue streams. That is: cleaning; home help services; and gardening. Our new franchisees recognise
								that this is effectively three businesses in one. In our home help service we are tapping into a gap in the market where demand is rising and where the
								competition is still relatively low.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our start-up fee is low compared with the sector average. Indeed for many this initially is concerning. Will I get everything I need? Will I get
								the support and training? Am I going to be missing something that I would get if I paid £5,000 or £10,000 for a similar business model? All of these
								concerns are frequently shared with me by people like you. In the last 7 weeks, at least 7 people have spoken to me and realised – hey yes in fact 
								you do get a complete package, training and full support. We don’t leave anything out. So rest assured. The money you save when you join us is just
								that – money saved in your pocket.
							</li>
							<li>
								They recognised that our monthly fee is fixed and relatively low for the sector. That means we don’t take a percentage of your turnover. As your
								business grows you get to keep more of it. Over the lifetime of a business that can mean thousands of pounds saved. Our recent joiners recognised 
								and appreciated this point.
							</li>
							<li>
								Finally, when joining Diamond Home Support they are joining a family of businesses all supporting and learning from each other. As a franchisor
								we believe in constantly developing our network of businesses and often this is as simple as holding a mirror up to the network and saying – look
								this is what is working and this is what isn’t working. 70+ businesses all working together makes for a strong team. Our new franchisees recognise
								this and see the value in it.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>7 people in 7 weeks can’t be wrong!</p>
						<p>What that also means is that there are 7 territories no longer available that were at the end of 2015.</p>
						<p>If this has got you thinking why not find out about becoming a Diamond Home Support franchisee in your area. If you would like more information you can
							download our prospectus immediately here.</p>

						<h3>November 2015</h3>
						<p><b>Diamond Home Support Annual Meeting 2015</b> was held on 10 November. “This year has been our biggest annual meeting yet with more franchisees attending 
							this year than ever before. This year’s event included a workshop element, presentations from franchisees and an external speaker, Brenda Cameron, 
							who spoke on goal setting and motivation. We also announced our 2015 award winners as follows: Franchisee of the Year went to Connie in Norwich; 
							our Runner-Up award was won jointly by Tim in South Lincolnshire and Astrid and Ian in Callington; our Best Newcomer went to Lynda in Windsor. 
							As usual we had a great time and a day full of inspiration. We very much look forward to next years event.” Andrew Watton, Managing Director.</p>

						<h3>March 2015</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support hold first Regional Meeting in the South West of England. “On 10th March we held our first Regional Meeting and was greeted 
						with a full 100% attendance by our franchisees in the South West. We had a terrific day discussing various aspects of our business at the Exeter 
						Court Hotel. We all learnt a good deal from each other and it was a great way to spend a day. Our franchise network is blessed to have very committed
						and proactive individuals across the UK and it was certainly very evident in the South West.” Andrew Watton</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>February 2015</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support announce the launch of our Pathway to Success – a 100+ step process to guide new franchisees through the first year in business.
						Managing Director, Andrew Watton said “Our Pathway to Success is a further way that our franchisees can be supported, particularly through that difficult
						first year in business. It is a comprehensive 100+ step process and compliments our existing training and support mechanisms. This document has been added
						to our existing franchise business package which remains £1,495+vat. We continue to keep our start up fee low to reduce the risk to our franchisees and 
						yet provide everything required to run a successful business – delivered in a modern, accessible way. Yes we provide you with a large package when you join
						us with hard copies of our main Manuals, but we also give you online access to a wealth of additional information and resources. Yes we provide face-to-face
						training, but in addition we also provide access to a suite of online training videos and regular live webinar sessions. We continually seek to improve what
						we offer, whilst maintaining relatively low fees, and we think our Pathway to Success is a very considerable addition.”</p>

						<h3>December 2014</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support Celebrates 2014! Diamond Home Support, the cleaning and home help management franchise, is celebrating another successful year. 
						The franchise network ends 2014 with over 70 franchisees in the UK and Ireland. Managing Director, Andrew Watton, said, “2014 has been a very successful
						year for our business in a number of ways. Firstly, because we have grown our network to over 70 franchisees. Secondly, because we now have the potential
						to offer our cleaning, home help and gardening services to around 50% of the UK. But thirdly because, with our franchisees, we are growing a stronger 
						network in depth. That means more franchisees with bigger, better businesses. Even as we end the year no less than 7 of our existing franchisees have 
						extended their territory during the month of December alone! That shows confidence in the business model and confidence in our franchise network.”</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>November 2014</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support holds 2014 Annual Meeting. On 11th November 2014 franchisees from the Diamond Home Support network got together for our annual 
						meeting. The event took place in Sittingbourne with franchisees attending from all over the UK and Ireland.</p>
						<p>Amongst other things we celebrated our Franchisee of the Year award winners – Astrid and Ian who run our Callington and Tavistock areas. We also 
							presented our Runner-Up award which went to Connie who runs our Norwich and Great Yarmouth areas.</p>
						<p>Managing Director, Andrew Watton, said “Today we held our biggest and best Annual Meeting yet. It was a superb day with many franchisees travelling
						long distances to take part. We heard inspiring stories from a number of franchisees and it also gave us the opportunity to share with the network our
						exciting plans for 2015! The Diamond Home Support franchise network continues to grow and, most importantly, grows stronger with each year that goes by.”</p>

						<h3>April 2014</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support celebrate a terrific start to 2014 with no less than 5 new franchisees joining in March alone. Managing Director, Andrew Watton
						said – “Diamond Home Support welcomes 5 new franchisees during March. All of our new franchisees, and indeed our existing network of 50+ franchisees, 
						benefit from: a low initial fee; a low monthly fee; good quality marketing material; an initial 3 month marketing launch; and training and ongoing support
						throughout the lifetime of the business. We believe we have developed a low risk franchising model which enables our franchisees to concentrate on what 
						matters – building their business and earning money. Our start-up fee is currently £1.295+vat, which includes a £200 discount, and this comes with a 
						complete start-up package and exclusive territory.”</p>

					<article>
						<h3>November 2013</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support holds 2013 Annual Meeting. On 12th November 2013 franchisees from the Diamond Home Support network got together for our annual 
							meeting. The event took place in Birmingham with franchisees attending from all over the UK and Ireland.</p>

							time a Runner-Up award which went to Brian who runs our Stoke-on-Trent area.</p>
						<p>Managing Director, Andrew Watton, said “It is days like today that show that as a franchise network we have matured and developed hugely over the past
							couple of years. We have all shared today in each others successes and learnt a great deal about how to move on and develop bigger, better businesses.
							We also celebrate the fantastic achievements of our franchisees and in particular this year our award winners Brian, Sue and Ian. In both cases they 
							have built good, solid businesses in a relatively short period of time; they have learnt from mistakes and overcome challenges which puts them in a 
							position to continue to grow at a terrific rate. They are also demonstrating the work/life balance that can be achieved from running a successful 
							home-based business such as Diamond Home Support.”</p>

						<h3>September 2013</h3>
						<p>On 9th September 2013 Diamond Home Support launched it’s successful cleaning franchise operation in the Republic of Ireland. Managing Director, Andrew
						Watton, said “Today Diamond Home Support becomes an international franchise. After a very successful period of growth within the UK we can proudly spread
						the word of our brand beyond the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.” Further information about the Ireland business can be found at www.diamondhomesupport.ie</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>April 2013</h3>
						<p>Diamond Home Support announce another new business extension module for their franchisees. From May 2013 franchisees will be able to offer gardening 
							services in addition to the existing cleaning, ironing and Home Assist Service support. This provides our franchisees with three separate revenue streams 
							all for the same low price. Managing Director, Andrew Watton, said “When I set out to create a cleaning franchise I wanted to do things differently.
							I wanted to re-balance the risk that franchisees are exposed to and create a model that represented a much better business proposition for potential 
							franchisees.</p>
						<p>This I did in two ways. Firstly, by reducing the financial exposure with low start-up costs and low ongoing fees. This has been achieved and means our 
							franchisees’ financial risk has been lowered.</p>
						<p>Secondly, in addition to reducing financial risk I wanted to increase earning potential. We want to offer more services to more people. The introduction 
							of the Home Assist Service in January 2012 was an important part of this process. Indeed such is the potential within that service that we could easily 
							have launched that as a separate stand alone franchise.</p>
						<p>Now we intend to go further by introducing our gardening service. Again, we could have considered this as a stand-alone franchise, but as with the Home 
							Assist Service, we will be providing it to all Diamond Home Support franchisees at no extra cost. So our franchisees will shortly have three separate 
							service areas: cleaning, home support and gardening. That’s three separate revenue streams.</p>
						<p>By introducing this further business module we will enable our franchisees to extend their services to both existing clients and new clients too.</p>
